#	Solution Manual For PRML

### Instruction
This is a Solution Manual for the famous book [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf).

The Manual is written in LaTex, and I ommit other files generated by Tex, so that you can only view the [pdf file for solutions](https://github.com/GoldenCheese/PRML-learning/blob/master/Solution%20Manual%20For%20PRML.pdf). This is mainly because of my concern about infringement of PRML's copyright.
I will keep update the solutions as my learning process goes on.

There are some solutions that I am not sure. I have listed here: Problem 2.37, Problem 2.58, Problem 3.13, Problem 3.14, Problem 3.16.

It you have any question, find any wrong solution or come up with better ideas about the problems I listed above, please feel free to contact with me <zhengqigao@163.com> or <14307130100@fudan.edu.cn>

Because too many people have asked me for the whole solutions, I will now upload an updated version online. Moreover, I have emailed Mr. Bishop, and there was actually an official solution manual published by Springer. [You can find it here](https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9780387310732).

Finally, there is a question confused me for a long time. Is is legal for me to write a solution manual and upload it online publicly? PRML is not writte by me and there is actually an offical solution manual:-) Can anyone fammiliar with laws give me an answer?

I want to address several issues here: (1) Currently I still do not get the permission of Mr. Bishop to upload this solution manual online. Therefore, maybe I will withdraw this solution maunal someday if it is illegal. (2) This solution manual is only meant to be used as personal study reference, **please donnot take it for other purposes, e.g., upload to other websites**.

### Update List

**Sep 22,2018**

Hooray! Currently, I have finished all the solutions in Chapter 1-6 and already upload it online.

**Oct 23,2018**

Hooray! Currently, I have finished all the solutions before Chapter 7(included). However, the update process may be suspended lately because of the heavy workload of my lab projects.

**Nov 26,2018**

Hooray! Currently, I have (partly) finished chapter 8. Starting from section 8.4.4, I have found that many equations in the book are quite different from what I derive. Therefore, the corresponding exercises (8.19-8.29) are left behind. 

**Dec 24,2018**

Hooray! Currently, I have finished chapter 9.

It is a godd day today, suitable for telling him/her I love you! He/She will definitely agree to be you bf/gf ! As once a famous guy has said: The bread will have of, the love will also have of. Merry Christmas!

**Jan 31,2019**

Currently, I have finished all the problems before Problem 10.26. However, I may suspend updating the solution manual due to several personal reasons. I promise that I will get back on 13th Feb.
